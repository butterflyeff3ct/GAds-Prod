## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **"Email notifications are DISABLED"**

**Check:**
1. `.streamlit/secrets.toml` has `[email_notifications]` section
2. `enabled = true` (not "True" or 1)
3. All required fields filled in
4. Restart Streamlit after changing secrets

### **"SMTP Authentication failed"**

**Most common causes:**
1. ❌ Using regular password instead of App Password
2. ❌ App Password has spaces (should be: `abcdefghijklmnop`)
3. ❌ 2-Step Verification not enabled
4. ❌ Wrong Gmail address

**Fix:**
- Regenerate App Password
- Copy it carefully (no spaces!)
- Double-check email address

### **"Test email sent but I didn't receive it"**

**Check:**
1. **Spam/Junk folder** (most common!)
2. Email address correct?
3. Wait 1-2 minutes (SMTP can be slow)
4. Check Gmail's "Sent" folder to verify it was sent

### **"Email looks broken/no formatting"**

- Some email clients don't support HTML
- Plain text fallback is included
- Test with Gmail, Outlook, and mobile

### **Error: "SMTPException"**

**Possible causes:**
1. Network/firewall blocking port 587
2. Gmail temporary block (try again in 10 mins)
3. Daily sending limit reached (500 emails/day)
