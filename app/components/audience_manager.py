            - Cart Abandoners: +50% to +100% (high intent)
            - Past Purchasers: +30% to +80% (proven buyers)
            
            **In-Market:**
            - Active buyers: +20% to +40%
            - Recent research: +10% to +30%
            
            **Affinity:**
            - Related interests: 0% to +20%
            - Broad interests: -10% to +10%

            - High-value segments: +30% to +100%

            2. Collect performance data by audience
            3. Identify high-performing segments
            4. Set bid adjustments based on data
            
            **Switch to Targeting when:**
            - You have clear winner segments
            - Budget is limited
            - Need to focus on specific demographics
            
            ### Example Strategy
            ```
            Mode: Observation
            - Past Purchasers: +80%
            - In-Market Electronics: +30%
